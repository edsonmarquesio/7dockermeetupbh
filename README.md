# 7ยบ Docker MeetupBH

On April 24, 2019 I had the honor of performing a presentation in the Docker community of Belo Horizonte with the theme: Dockerizando in the Windows Environment.

## In this talk I approached the following topics:

- Why run Docker on Windows?
- Why run your applications on Containers and not VMs?
- What is the process of installing Docker on Windows
- Running your first Docker container on Windows
- Use cases
- Differences and similarities between Docker on Windows and Linux
